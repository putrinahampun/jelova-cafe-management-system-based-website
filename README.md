# ü•òJelova Cafe Management System Based on Websiteü•ò

## üñºÔ∏è Project Description 
**Introduction**

The Jelova Caf√© & Resto Management Website is designed to replace the manual management system of Jelova Caf√© & Resto, which has caused inefficiencies such as order errors, delayed service, and cashier overload, especially during busy times. This new system aims to streamline operations by providing an efficient, fast, and accurate service platform, thus enhancing customer experience and improving staff productivity. The website is intended for the caf√©'s owner and staff, ensuring smoother order management, reducing confusion in the kitchen, and easing the cashier's workload to deliver optimal service.

**Features**

- **User Registration & Login**
  User registration is used to store new user data, while user login verifies the data of users who have registered through the registration feature. Login verification uses authentication services with the Auth Facades library.
- **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  Role-Based Access Control refers to a system where different users have specific roles. For this website, there are three roles: Cashier, Waiter, and Kitchen staff. The Cashier is responsible for managing the caf√©'s income. The Waiter is responsible for serving customers' orders. The Kitchen staff is responsible for updating the order status, whether it is still being cooked or ready to be served. This feature can be implemented using Middleware from Laravel.
- **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, & Delete)**
  CRUD refers to the technical features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in the system. Each role has access to these features based on their specific tasks.
